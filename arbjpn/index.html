            with the realization of its convenience as well as other useful benefit that it can provide that will suffice a person like me, but it is still 
            depends on some people. How is my iPhone 11 cam? great right?! (^_^) . If there is a night view there is a sunset view too this amazing blend of the grayish sky 
            and white in the middle and certainly the sunset which is most of its color is orange but there will be purple and pink sky view too, It really depends in the seasons I guess 
            I will observe this experiment to know what are the best month or season for great views in Tokyo.

            While on my way to Yokohama suddenly I realize I wanted to try filming myself while exploring around Japan just like outside my hometown 
            here in Tokyo so I made my IRL streaming account in <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adeeyaansama"><b>Twitch.tv</b></a> but I will need more equiment like another phone so I decided to game stream first then 
            then I when I earn money I can finally buy my set up and even purchase a better bicycle for travel.

            I really like going outside by riding my electric bicycle (Mama-chari), I actully took this photo while
            I was doing a delivery via Uber Eats. Since COVID-19 Uber Eats was a big help as a side hustle for survival in Tokyo but still need 
            to take precautions in life. The scenery every night in Tokyo may vary but it is one of the best night view you will ever experience to see
            because Tokyo is a wide city in Japan. Anyone can try to climb up the Notorious SKYTREE TOWER in SUMIDA area or TOKYO TOWER in MINATO area 
            which of the two are worth climbing I'm guessing HEHEH, I have never tried those yet but when I have a chance together with my family would be
            a great timing Yeah!!.

                            <p>Hello there! I have never made such design like what you are looking at right now, I was surprised when I checked how it will look then I saw this  with 
                                the help of <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Teamtreehouse.</a> I thought continuing to be creative in life is a great way to spend it and make such appealing visuals that a human eyes have never
                                seen. There was saying just keeping doing what you want and never stop you will only stop when you can't move a single part of your body so I will keep going
                                on enhancing my development skills. Coding isn't hard it is about how passionate you are to create something helpful for lifestyles. I decided to code my own website because it was one of my dream to achieve and make 
                                a web presence in the WORLD WIDE WEB and for my career as well as myself who likes adventure to just do what I can do and how creative I can get all the way.

                and just build something that makes me creative and I chose to enter an IT College called 日本工学院専門学校(Japan Technical College) there I met many student who are new to the course
                like me and there were students who already have knowledge in IT but not in Web Developing. Learning a new skill is the best choice I made and then the hurdles and obstacle started right there.

                    Everytime we get instruct to put every html tags and css tags in everyday lessons in
                building a Web page was hard as a fresh learner since IT course isn't only about building Websites but also learning other language to be embedded
                in html documents like PHP. PHP was the language I was looking for to become a SE or System Engineer in a Japanese companies but PHP is a server-side programming
                language so to be a Web Developer I have to push myself to learning these additional programming languages.
